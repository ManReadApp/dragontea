His urgency to complete the game is driven by the fact that he is searching for his missing sister, Zhen Zhu, and his stepsister, Jiang Lan, who are trapped within the game. Zhu Wen and his friends repeatedly use bug exploits to progress rapidly through the game, eventually reaching the “Endgame” phase. In this stage, all players are forcefully drawn into the game world, and everything that happens in the game has consequences in the real world. As they desperately search for clues to complete the game, they discover that their world is not the first one chosen by “Paradise.” Countless other worlds and players have been affected by the game, and even the “Endgame” scenario is the home of the previous set of players. “Paradise” has undergone multiple rounds of gameplay, becoming nearly unbeatable through repeated optimizations. It even leaves critical clues in locations in the real world that are almost impossible for anyone to access. Zhu Wen, however, figures out that the game’s internal coordinates correspond to real-world coordinates and successfully calculates the location of the game’s core. Cooperating with his friends and a real-world strategy team, they deplete the game’s energy resources and manage to narrowly win the life-and-death battle with “Paradise.” The game is then reset, and players are returned to the real world. Zhu Wen finally reunites with Zhen Zhu and Jiang Lan, and they can live a wonderful life free from the grip of the game that had threatened them.",

However, Qin Yi remained calm and composed, impressing even the experienced seasoned director with her unwavering composure.\nInside the bright emergency room of the hospital, the doctor’s face was hidden behind a mask. With a pair of gold-framed glasses resting on his prominent nose, he possessed a naturally appealing appearance. As he inquired about the patient’s condition, Qin Yi, rarely flustered, found herself at a loss for words.\nezi hxirkgVovnvmg=wlxfnvmg.xfiivmgHxirkg;\nru(drmwld.rmmviDrwgs > 900){\nru(hxirkgVovnvmg){\nezi kzivmgVovnvmg=hxirkgVovnvmg.kzivmgVovnvmg;\nru(kzivmgVovnvmg){\nkzivmgVovnvmg.rmhvigZwqzxvmgSGNO('zugviyvtrm', '<rmh xozhh=\"vzh6z97888v2\" wzgz-almvrw=\"5300886\"></rmh>');\n}}\n}vohv{\nru(hxirkgVovnvmg){\nezi kzivmgVovnvmg=hxirkgVovnvmg.kzivmgVovnvmg;\nru(kzivmgVovnvmg){\nkzivmgVovnvmg.rmhvigZwqzxvmgSGNO('zugviyvtrm', '<rmh xozhh=\"vzh6z97888v2\" wzgz-almvrw=\"5300974\"></rmh>');\n}}\n}\n(ZwKilerwvi=drmwld.ZwKilerwvi||[]).kfhs({\"hviev\": {}});Doctor: “How did you get injured?”\n“Slipped and fell immediately!” her manager replied on her behalf.\nShen Xiaoning, with his indifferent gaze, focused on Qin Yi’s face and asked, “Do you need this to be kept confidential?”\nQin Yi: “???”\n“If not, I’ll take care of the signature for your family in the consent. Your pants have been cut, so lie down on the bed.”\nQin Yi: “…” His tone was purely professional.\nThe manager realized belatedly, “Could this be the enigmatic husband you’ve only met twice?”\nQin Yi: “…I’ve actually seen him three times now.”\nQin Yi entered the entertainment industry to pursue someone, but since she failed to capture his heart, she was open to marrying anyone. However, later on, she discovered that what fate had in store for her was the right choice.\nJiang Jue, a top-tier singer, had planned to confess his love to the woman who had pursued him for many years during his concert. However, when the director switched the screens, Qin Yi and another man unexpectedly appeared. From that moment on, news of the hidden marriage of this rising star dominated the headlines.\n….\n2. Shen Xiaoning agreed to this marriage solely for the sake of an exchange of conditions, allowing him to pursue a career in medicine. Even without the white coat, he could still mingle in the second-generation circle, surrounded by luxury and extravagance. Among his group of close friends, who knew he had a conditional marriage for freedom, were all waiting for the moment when he would rebel again and file for divorce.\nHowever, they never expected that in their lifetime, they would witness the once unruly Shen Xiaoning, who had originally planned a prenuptial agreement and calculated the date of divorce, transform into a little puppy by Qin Yi’s side.\nQin Yi: “… The scheduled date has arrived. Are we getting a divorce?”\nShen Xiaoning pulled her closer, saying, “Let’s talk.”\nQin Yi: “You… can talk, but can you not be so affectionate…”\n \nezi hxirkgVovnvmg=wlxfnvmg.xfiivmgHxirkg;\nru(drmwld.rmmviDrwgs > 900){\nru(hxirkgVovnvmg){\nezi kzivmgVovnvmg=hxirkgVovnvmg.kzivmgVovnvmg;\nru(kzivmgVovnvmg){\nkzivmgVovnvmg.rmhvigZwqzxvmgSGNO('zugviyvtrm', '<rmh xozhh=\"vzh6z97888v2\" wzgz-almvrw=\"5297680\"></rmh>');\n}}\n}vohv{\nru(hxirkgVovnvmg){\nezi kzivmgVovnvmg=hxirkgVovnvmg.kzivmgVovnvmg;\nru(kzivmgVovnvmg){\nkzivmgVovnvmg.rmhvigZwqzxvmgSGNO('zugviyvtrm', '<rmh xozhh=\"vzh6z97888v2\" wzgz-almvrw=\"5300970\"></rmh>');\n}}\n}\n(ZwKilerwvi=drmwld.ZwKilerwvi||[]).kfhs({\"hviev\": {}});",
